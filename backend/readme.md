the issue with returning res.send() or res.json() comes down to how Express.js handles middleware functions and TypeScript's type checking. Let me explain the key differences and why we should avoid returning response methods:

Why return res.send() is problematic:
TypeScript Type Mismatch:

Express's RequestHandler type expects middleware to return void or Promise<void>

When you do return res.send(), you're returning the Response object

This causes the TypeScript error you're seeing

Express Behavior:

Express doesn't actually use the return value from handlers

The response is sent when you call res.send(), regardless of whether you return it

Returning it is unnecessary and causes type issues
